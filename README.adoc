# CDE Experience

Goal of this repository is to provide some few easy examples of demo to run on CDE.

It relies on Data generated be Datagen.



## Data Generation

To generate data, there are two ways:

1. Use the script link:gen_data.sh[gen_data.sh] to generate data. You will need to change variables at the top of the script to match your environment. 
    __WARNING: install jq before running the script, example: yum install jq__
    
1. Do it manually by following below instructions to generate data using swagger (or directly API) of Datagen (a service deployed in your base cluster).


### Plants

Use Datagen to generate data in _hdfs_parquet_ with following parameters:

- Model file: link:datagen-models/plant-model.json[plant-model]
- Batches: 1
- Rows: 1000
- Threads: 1

__N.B.: You can change the model to use another country than UK & France, by replacing or adding something among USA, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan, India, China, Tunisia, Israel etc... __


### Sensors

Use Datagen to generate data in _hdfs_parquet_ with following parameters:

- Model file: link:datagen-models/sensor-model.json[sensor-model]
- Batches: 10
- Rows: 10000
- Threads: 10


### Sensors Data

Use Datagen to generate data in _hdfs_parquet_ with following parameters:

- Model file: link:datagen-models/sensor-data-model.json[sensor-data-model]
- Batches: 10
- Rows: 100000
- Threads: 10

__N.B.: You can change the model to use another country than UK & France, by replacing or adding something among USA, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan, India, China, Tunisia, Israel etc... __


## Sensors

- Model file: link:datagen-models/sensor-model.json[sensor-model]
- Batches: 10
- Rows: 10000
- Threads: 10
